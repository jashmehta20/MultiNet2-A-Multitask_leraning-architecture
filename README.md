# MultiNet-A-Multitask_leraning-architecture

This repository contains the source code of Multinet and baselines from the paper, [End-to-End Multi-Task Learning with Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10704), introduced by [Shikun Liu](https://shikun.io/), [Edward Johns](https://www.robot-learning.uk/), and [Andrew Davison](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/).


To run any multinet, `python train_multinet.py --dataroot /data --apply_augmentation --ckpt_dir /ckpt --epochs 200 --batch_size 4 --backbone resnet101 --architecture fcn`
